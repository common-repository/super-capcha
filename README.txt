We would like to thank the WordPress staff for being tolerable and understanding of our pluign
in the past and its requirement of placing a link in the footer to display credit for the plugin
as well as provide additional security to let bots know the site is secured.

This did not last however, even after pardoned when the guidlines came out stating that 
NEW PLUGINS couldn't have forced links in public, a Moderator though it would be best 
and commanded that we remove the by-line after being fully educated that this would reduce 
the security of the plugin.

Because of this, we have COMPLETELY removed Super CAPTCHA from the repository and will no longer 
be recommending our 17,000 customers to use WordPress.
